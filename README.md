# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

## Overview

The A* (A-star) algorithm is a powerful and widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is designed to efficiently find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, using a combination of actual cost and estimated cost to guide its search. This project implements the A* algorithm with advanced features, including dynamic path optimization, real-time updates, and heuristic customization.

## Features

- **Efficient Pathfinding:** Uses A* algorithm to compute the shortest path with optimal performance.
- **Customizable Heuristics:** Supports various heuristic functions, including Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and custom heuristics.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Integrates dynamic re-planning to adapt to changes in the environment and update paths in real-time.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Provides an interactive web interface to visualize pathfinding results and node exploration.
